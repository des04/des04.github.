            <p>
                PTEC stands for Pembina Trails Early College and is an
                advanced technologically focused education program for
                highschool students within the Pembina Trails School
                Division. Students within the program are taught
                software, hardware, cyber security and cloud
                administration skills while being imersed in a world of
                innovation and technology at the University Of Manitoba.
                Students who attend PTEC take core courses at
                their regular highschools before or after being bussed
                to PTEC.

            <h1>Grade 9</h1>
            <p>
                Grade nine students are taught how to code C# using unity
                and visual studio. By the end of the first half of the
                school year, students are capable of creating 2D video
                games. In the second half of the year, students are taught
                networking essentials, allowing them to attain a solid
                understanding of internetworks.

            <h1>Grade 10</h1>
            <p>
                Grade ten students expand their software development
                knowlege, but in a web focused fashion as opposed to
                a video game focused fashion. Grade tens learn HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript as well as web design priciples in
                the first half of the school year. By this point,
                they are capable of creating fully asthetic, interactive
                websites. While grade 10 students are learning web
                development at school (on top of their core courses),
                they also must take an online course in IT essentials.
                This course teaches hardware on top of many other
                things to students. In the second half of the year,
                grade tens expand their knowledge on networking,
                improving in terms of cyber security and cloud
                administration. It is also around this time that
                students are paired with companies for internships.
                At the end of grade ten, students will choose which field
                to specialize in for their grade eleven and twelve years.
                The two fields being Software Development and Cyber
                Security and Cloud Administration.

            <h1>Grades 11 and 12</h1>
            <p>
                It is at this point that students have selected a stream
                that they will specialize in at the Manitoba Institute
                of Trades and Technology. The two avaible streams are
                Software Development or Cyber Security and Cloud
                Administration. The courses that the students will take
                at The Manitoba Institude of Trades and Technology
                (communly reffered to as M.I.T.T.) would normally cost
                an individual eight thousand dollars, however, for
                students who went to PTEC the courses are completely
                free. Upon graduation, students will have elite-level
                diplomas as well as advanced workplace skills.
