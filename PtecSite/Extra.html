            <h1>Cumulative Assessment</h1>
            <p>
                An example of the kind of work grade ten's do at PTEC
                is this very site! This website's creator/designer
                Des Langan made this web page as a submission for his
                CSS cumulative assessment. He is also the one writing
                this, so for the rest of this paragraph he will stop
                refering to himself in the third person because it
                feels a little weird. For this assignment I still need
                to add some things, some examples would be spans and
                focus selectors for anchors. If you have no idea
                what a span or an anchor even is, dont worry. What I'm
                going to do in this paragraph is implement everything
                I still need to implement and explain how I learned
                it at PTEC.
            </p>
            <h2>Spans</h2>
            <p>
                Spans are things people use to group inline elements
                in a document. For example,
                <span style="color:blueviolet">
                    this text is different than the preceding text
                    because it is within a span div that has stylized
                    the text to be purple.
                </span>
                My class over at PTEC learned about spans a few weeks
                ago via our grade ten software development teacher,
                Mr. Hardman, explaining them with a PowerPoint about
                spans behind him. He also had us do a few activities
                related to spans so we understood why and how they
                were used.
            </p>
            <h2>Selectors for Anchors</h2>
            <p>
                An anchor put very simply is a link. Now, a regular
                default <a href="">link</a> (as you can see) looks
                quite bland. So, using HTML and CSS at PTEC we were
                taught how to stylize links to make them look much
                more asthetically pleasing. An example of a stylized
                set of links would be the links at the top of this
                page in the nav bar. These links use the hover
                attribute, but sadly, none of these links use
                the focus for visited attributes. The focus
                attribute allows for links to change colour while
                being clicked. Here is an <a href="" id="focusExample">example</a>
                of one that does this (you can tell because it changes
                to aqua while being clicked). The visited attribute
                does the same thing as the focus attribute, only
                after the click happens. For example, have you ever
                heard of a "visited link"? In google, whenever you've
                already clicked a link, it'll be a different colour.
                This is because it uses the visited attribute. Here
                is an <a href="About.html" id="visitedExample">example</a>
                that will turn yellow after you've visited the about
                page / once it has been clicked.
            </p>
            <h2>Animations</h2>
            <p>
                Animations are everywhere on websites, from
                asthetically pleasing loading screens to interactive
                buttons. For me to get a good mark on this website,
                I must include an animation that wasn't discussed in
                class. So, here is my
                <div id="animationExample">
                    example.
                </div>
                (Hover over the word "example" for the animation to
                commence.)
            </p>

        </div>

    </main>
